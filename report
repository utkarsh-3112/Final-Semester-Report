15

2.12.1 Key Concepts
• Version Control: Git allows developers to keep track of changes to their code- base over time. Each change is recorded as a commit, which represents a snapshot of the project at a specific point in time.
• Repositories: A Git repository (repo) is a collection of files and directories that are tracked by Git. It contains the entire history of the project, including all commits and branches.
• Commits: A commit is a record of changes to the repository. It includes a unique identifier (commit hash), a commit message describing the changes, and the au- thor’s information. Commits are organized in a linear sequence, forming a com- mit history.
• Branches: Git allows developers to create separate branches to work on new fea- tures or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Branches provide isolation and allow for parallel development. The main branch, typically named ”master” or ”main”, represents the stable version of the project.
• Merging: Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. Git uses merge commits to integrate changes and resolve any conflicts that may arise.
• Remote Repositories: Git enables collaboration among multiple developers by allowing them to share their repositories with others over the internet. Remote repositories serve as a central location for storing and exchanging code.
2.12.2 Basic Workflow
1. Initialize a Repository: To start using Git, you first need to initialize a new
repository in your project directory.
git init
2. Add and Commit Changes: After making changes to your files, you can add them to the staging area and commit them to the repository.
        git add .
        git commit -m "Commit message"
16

3. Create and Switch Branches: To work on a new feature or bug fix, create a new branch and switch to it.
      git checkout -b new-feature
4. Merge Branches: Once your changes are complete, merge them back into the main branch.
      git checkout main
      git merge new-feature
5. Push and Pull Changes: Share your changes with others by pushing them to a remote repository or pull changes from a remote repository to your local machine.
      git push origin main
      git pull origin main
6. Resolve Conflicts: If there are conflicts between branches during a merge, re- solve them manually by editing the affected files and committing the changes.

During the Knowledge Acquisition phase, I focused on acquiring a comprehensive un- derstanding of the domain and technologies relevant to the project. This phase served as the foundation for subsequent development activities, ensuring that I was equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to execute the project successfully.
3.2.1 Understanding the Domain
The first step of the Knowledge Acquisition phase involved gaining a deep understand- ing of the domain, specifically the requirements and challenges associated with opti- mizing the performance and scalability of a high-traffic API system. This included researching common practices, guidelines, and strategies for handling large volumes of requests, mitigating bottlenecks, and ensuring reliable service delivery. The project aimed to improve the efficiency and responsiveness of a backend system dealing with financial transactions.
3.2.2 Exploring Technologies
Simultaneously, I explored the technologies and tools required to implement the desired functionality of the web application. This included a detailed investigation of event- driven architectures, message brokering systems like Kafka, and backend optimization techniques using Java and Spring Boot. Key technologies and tools examined included:
• Kafka: Utilized for managing high volumes of requests by separating the request submission from the processing logic, ensuring system responsiveness even under heavy load. In our context, Kafka facilitated the publication of events in the Atropos system, which asynchronously handled the initial flow where the Bill Payments Recon API experienced overwhelming requests.
• Consumer Configuration: Adjustment of Kafka consumer settings to optimize the simultaneous processing of records, maintaining load balance and preventing system overloads. Configuration adjustments in Atropos, such as ‘fetch.max.bytes‘, ‘max.poll.records‘, and ‘queued.max.messages.kbytes‘, were made to manage the rate of record retrieval and processing effectively.
• Spring Boot: Employed for developing backend services with efficiency and scalability. In our implementation, Spring Boot facilitated the development of a new API, which, when called by Hades, published events to Kafka topics.
19

• Grafana: Utilized for monitoring system metrics, including P99 latency. Grafana enabled the visualization of performance metrics for our APIs, aiding in the iden- tification and resolution of performance bottlenecks.
• Kibana: Deployed for log management and analysis. Kibana provided insights into log data, enabling effective system monitoring and debugging through visu- alization of data from Elasticsearch.
• Jenkins: Employed for continuous integration and deployment to ensure reli- able and automated deployment processes. Jenkins facilitated the setup of CI/CD pipelines for automating build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring seamless deployment of system updates.
I also evaluated potential integrations and dependencies to ensure compatibility and seamless interaction between different components of the application.
3.2.3 Learning Curves and Skill Development
As part of the Knowledge Acquisition phase, I identified areas where additional learn- ing and skill development were required to effectively contribute to the project. This involved self-study, online courses, tutorials, and hands-on experimentation to gain pro- ficiency in:
• Backend Development: This aspect entails enhancing the functionality and effi- ciency of the backend systems responsible for processing requests. By leveraging Java and Spring Boot, developers focus on writing optimized code that improves system performance and scalability.
• Asynchronous Processing: Involves the implementation of event-driven archi- tectures, where the processing of requests is decoupled from the submission. By utilizing Kafka, the system can handle requests asynchronously, enhancing re- sponsiveness and scalability.
• PerformanceOptimization:Strategiesandtechniquesareemployedtofine-tune the performance metrics of the API system. This includes optimizing throughput (the rate at which requests are processed) and latency (the time taken for a request to receive a response), ensuring optimal system performance under varying loads.
• Configuration Management: This aspect involves understanding and adjusting configurations within the Kafka consumer to manage system loads efficiently.
20

By fine-tuning settings such as the maximum number of records processed si- multaneously and the maximum number of requests sent at once, developers can balance loads and optimize system performance.
• Monitoring and Logging: To ensure system reliability and performance, de- velopers utilize monitoring tools like Grafana to track important metrics such as request rates and response times. Additionally, logging tools like Kibana are employed for effective log management, enabling developers to identify and trou- bleshoot issues promptly.
• Continuous Integration and Deployment: Utilizing automation tools like Jenk- ins, developers streamline the build, testing, and deployment processes. Con- tinuous Integration (CI) ensures that code changes are regularly integrated and tested, while Continuous Deployment (CD) automates the deployment of vali- dated changes to production environments, reducing manual effort and minimiz- ing the risk of errors.
By investing time and effort in skill development upfront, I was better equipped to tackle the challenges of the project as it progressed.
3.3 COLLABORATION AND KNOWLEDGE SHARING
Regular meetings, brainstorming sessions, and peer reviews were conducted to ex- change insights, discuss findings, and address any questions or uncertainties. This col- laborative approach fostered a supportive learning environment where we could lever- age each other’s expertise and experiences to accelerate our learning curve and collec- tively drive the project forward.
3.3.1 Prototyping and Proof of Concepts
The Prototyping and Proof of Concept phase is a pivotal step in the development jour- ney, especially when working on complex backend systems. This phase allows for the validation of the technical feasibility and viability of the project’s solution before committing to full-scale development. Let’s delve into the details of how this phase unfolded:
3.3.2 Defining Scope and Objectives
The first task was to clearly define the scope and objectives of the prototype applica- tion. This involved identifying the core features and functionalities necessary to achieve
21

the project’s goals. Key components such as API endpoint consolidation, event-driven processing with Kafka, integration with monitoring tools like Grafana and Kibana, and performance optimization were outlined as essential elements to include.
3.3.3 Designing Mockups and Wireframes
With the scope and objectives in mind, the next step was to visualize the user interface and experience of the prototype application. Mockups and wireframes were created using design tools or simple pen and paper to outline the layout, navigation flow, and interaction patterns of key screens and components. These visual representations served as a blueprint for the development process and facilitated communication and alignment throughout the project.
Collaboration and knowledge sharing played a crucial role during this phase. Regu- lar meetings were held to review the progress of the prototype development, brainstorm ideas for improvements, and gather feedback from team members. Peer reviews were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the design mockups and wireframes, ensur- ing that they accurately represented the intended user experience and met the project objectives.
By engaging in collaborative discussions and leveraging the diverse expertise within the team, we were able to refine the scope and objectives of the prototype application, validate its technical feasibility through proof of concepts, and design an intuitive user interface that met the needs of our target audience. This collaborative approach not only accelerated our learning curve but also fostered a sense of ownership and shared responsibility for the success of the project.
3.4 SOLUTION
To address this issue, we redesigned the flow to incorporate asynchronous processing. In the new architecture, the incoming requests are directed to a newly created API. This API then publishes an event to a message broker. Subscriptions within this message broker are configured to handle the asynchronous processing of these events by invok- ing the existing Service A API.
Previously, there were multiple APIs being called directly. This has been consolidated into a single API that accepts a JSON object as input. Based on an attribute within this JSON object, the event is published to a specific topic. Consumers subscribed to these topics will then call the appropriate existing APIs asynchronously.
22

To optimize the message broker’s configuration and ensure efficient handling of the request load, we made the following adjustments:
• Max.Tasks.Count: Defines the number of consumers for a topic. This value is limited by the number of partitions, with the default being one partition and one consumer.
• Consumer.Override.Max.Poll.Records: Specifies the number of records a con- sumer fetches and processes in one poll cycle.
• Max.Requests.In.Flight: Determines how many requests a consumer sends out simultaneously, with additional fetched records held in an in-memory buffer.
By adjusting these configurations, we were able to balance the load and improve the responsiveness of the system, ensuring that it could handle the increased volume of requests without performance degradation.

3.5 BACKEND DEVELOPMENT
Backend development serves as the backbone of our system, facilitating the manage- ment of business logic, data handling, and communication between the frontend inter- face and the database. Here’s a breakdown of the different aspects of backend develop- ment in our project:
3.5.1 Setup and Configuration
The journey into backend development commences with the setup and configuration of our development environment. Leveraging Java as the core programming language and Spring Boot for rapid application development, we initialize the necessary frameworks and tools required for our project. Additionally, we integrate PostgreSQL for robust database solutions and Git for version control to ensure efficient collaboration and code management throughout the development lifecycle.
3.5.2 Database Design and Modeling
A pivotal aspect of backend development involves designing and modeling the database schema. Utilizing Spring Data JPA in conjunction with Hibernate, we define database models using Java entities, abstracting away the complexities of SQL queries. We meticulously design the database schema, considering factors such as data relation- ships, normalization, and performance optimization. Furthermore, we employ Spring Data JPA’s migration system to efficiently manage database schema changes, ensuring seamless data integrity and consistency.
3.5.3 API Development
With the database schema established, we proceed to develop robust APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to expose functionality to the frontend interface and external clients. Leveraging Spring Boot’s powerful REST support, we define RESTful API endpoints for various resources in the application. These endpoints handle incoming HTTP requests, perform data validation, process business logic, and return appropriate HTTP responses in JSON format. Our APIs are meticulously designed to be consis- tent, predictable, and well-documented, facilitating seamless integration with frontend components and external systems.
24

3.5.4 Business Logic Implementation
Backend development encompasses the implementation of core business logic, includ- ing data processing, validation, and manipulation. Leveraging Java’s robust ecosystem and Spring’s dependency injection, we write functions and methods to manage user in- put, enforce business rules, and orchestrate interactions between different components of the system. Our business logic is encapsulated within Spring components, ensuring modularity, reusability, and maintainability of the codebase.
3.5.5 Authentication and Authorization
Security is paramount in backend development, particularly concerning user authenti- cation and authorization. Leveraging Spring Security’s comprehensive authentication and authorization mechanisms, we secure our application against unauthorized access and malicious attacks. We configure authentication backends, define user models, and implement access controls to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access protected resources. Additionally, we leverage Spring Security’s features such as CSRF protection, XSS prevention, and password hashing to mitigate common security vulnerabilities.
3.5.6 Testing and Debugging
Thorough testing and debugging are integral throughout the backend development pro- cess to identify and rectify any issues or bugs. We employ JUnit and Mockito for Java testing and Spring’s testing framework to develop unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to validate the functionality and reliability of backend components. Test-driven development (TDD) practices are employed to ensure that code changes un- dergo comprehensive testing before deployment to production. Additionally, we utilize debugging tools and techniques such as logging, error tracking, and remote debugging to diagnose and resolve issues efficiently, ensuring the stability and performance of the backend system.
3.5.7 Deployment and Scalability
Upon completion of backend development, we prepare for deployment and scalability of the application. We configure deployment environments using Kubernetes for con- tainer orchestration and Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery, establishing robust CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Leverag- ing AWS for hosting the application, we ensure scalability, reliability, and availability.
25

Additionally, we monitor application performance using Grafana for monitoring and alerting, track usage metrics, and implement scaling strategies such as horizontal scal- ing or auto-scaling to accommodate increased traffic and workload.
3.5.8 File Processing System Configuration
To efficiently process high volumes of data, we configured our system akin to real-time data streaming solutions like Amazon Kinesis and Apache Flink. This configuration al- lows for the effective processing of large files by breaking down the data into individual records and processing them asynchronously. The system ensures high throughput and low latency by leveraging Kafka for event streaming, enabling us to process millions of records with robust error handling and retry mechanisms. By adjusting Kafka consumer configurations such as ‘max.poll.records‘ and ‘max.requests.in.flight‘, we optimized the balance between load processing and system responsiveness, ensuring smooth and effi- cient data handling.
3.6 INTEGRATION AND TESTING
Integration and testing play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability, functionality, and performance of our system. In this section, we outline the integration of backend com- ponents and the various testing strategies employed to validate our application.
3.6.1 Integration of Backend Components
The integration of backend components involves seamlessly combining individual mod- ules, services, and APIs to form a cohesive system. Leveraging the Spring framework’s dependency injection and inversion of control, we integrate backend components such as controllers, services, repositories, and external APIs. In addition to Spring, we also utilize Retrofit, a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java, for integrating external APIs.
Retrofit simplifies the process of communicating with RESTful APIs by allowing us to define the API endpoints and request parameters as Java interfaces. It handles the conversion of JSON responses to Java objects and provides robust support for error handling and network operations. With Retrofit, we can efficiently consume APIs and incorporate external functionality into our backend system.
By adhering to established design patterns and architectural principles, such as the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and the Repository pattern, we ensure loose
26

coupling and high cohesion between components. This architectural approach facili- tates easier maintenance, scalability, and extensibility of our backend system. The use of Retrofit for API integration complements these principles by providing a seamless and efficient mechanism for communicating with external services.
3.6.2 Unit Testing
Unit testing is a fundamental aspect of our testing strategy, focusing on the validation of individual units or components in isolation. Using JUnit and Mockito frameworks for Java testing, we develop unit tests to verify the correctness of methods, functions, and classes within our backend components. By simulating different scenarios and edge cases, we ensure that each unit behaves as expected and adheres to specified re- quirements. Unit tests are automated and executed frequently during the development process, providing rapid feedback and identifying regressions early in the lifecycle.
3.6.3 Integration Testing
Integration testing is a critical phase in our testing strategy, focusing on evaluating the interactions and dependencies between integrated backend components. It ensures that these components function cohesively as a unified system, providing confidence in the stability and interoperability of the integrated solution.
We leverage the Spring framework’s testing capabilities, specifically the MockMVC module, for integration testing. MockMVC allows us to simulate HTTP requests and re- sponses, enabling comprehensive testing of controllers and their interactions with other components. Additionally, we utilize the REST Assured library, which provides a flu- ent API for testing RESTful APIs, to validate the communication between our backend services and external dependencies.
Our integration tests encompass a wide range of scenarios, including end-to-end user journeys, error handling, and data flow validation. By simulating API requests and responses, we verify the correctness of data transmission, authentication mechanisms, and response formats. This ensures that our system behaves as expected under various conditions and gracefully handles errors and edge cases.
In summary, integration testing plays a crucial role in validating the interoperability and functionality of our integrated backend components. By leveraging MockMVC and REST Assured, we can comprehensively test the communication between components
27

and ensure the reliability and robustness of our system.
3.6.4 Performance Testing
Performance testing is essential for evaluating system responsiveness, scalability, and resource utilization, particularly in handling individual records from uploaded files and making API calls for each record. Our approach, resembling real-time data stream- ing systems like Amazon Kinesis or Apache Flink, focuses on measuring the latency of processing individual records, especially the 99th percentile (P99) requests. This metric provides insight into typical latency, helping us understand system performance under normal conditions.
To conduct performance testing, we simulate file uploads with varying record counts and measure the time taken to process each record. We employ real-time monitoring and logging to capture and analyze API call latency for individual record processing. By adjusting the load and observing system response, we identify performance bottle- necks, scalability constraints, or areas needing optimization.
Our performance testing strategy includes the following key components:
• RequestPerSecond(RPS)Measurement:Wetrackthenumberofrequestspro- cessed by the system per second. This metric helps us understand the system’s throughput and its ability to handle concurrent requests. By increasing the num- ber of simulated file uploads and monitoring RPS, we can determine the system’s maximum capacity and identify any throughput limitations.
• Latency Analysis: In addition to measuring the average latency, we focus on the P99 latency, which represents the time within which 99
• Resource Utilization Monitoring: We continuously monitor system resources such as CPU, memory, and disk usage during performance testing. This helps us identify any resource bottlenecks that may impact the system’s ability to handle high loads. By correlating resource utilization with performance metrics, we can pinpoint areas that require optimization.
• Scalability Testing: We evaluate the system’s ability to scale horizontally and vertically by adding more processing nodes or increasing the capacity of exist- ing nodes. This involves testing the system under varying loads to ensure it can handle increased traffic without degradation in performance.
28

• Error Rate Tracking: Monitoring the error rate during performance testing is crucial for identifying issues related to request handling. We track the number of failed requests and analyze the root causes to improve system reliability and robustness.
• Real-TimeMonitoringandLogging:UtilizingtoolssuchasGrafanaandKibana, we set up dashboards to visualize key performance metrics in real-time. This allows us to quickly identify and address performance issues as they arise. De- tailed logs help us trace the flow of individual requests and diagnose problems effectively.
• Iterative Optimization: Performance testing is an ongoing process conducted throughout the development lifecycle. By iteratively testing and optimizing the system, we ensure that it meets the required performance criteria and can handle expected user traffic. This approach allows us to make incremental improvements and validate them against real-world scenarios.
Our iterative performance testing process occurs throughout development and be- fore production deployment, ensuring the system meets performance criteria and can handle expected user traffic. Focusing on individual record processing latency, request per second, and other key performance metrics provides valuable insights for optimiz- ing system performance and enhancing the user experience. This comprehensive ap- proach ensures that our web application is robust, scalable, and capable of delivering a high-quality user experience even under heavy load conditions.
